Hello! This is a game that I'm developing.
It is a factory/development game based on mindustry and factorio. This is probably one of my first games that I've worked on for more than a week. I am a beginner, so It's nothing special, and yes, I'm aware the code is horrible.
I will try to continue this project, and attempt to un-scramble my horrible code. I have the mechanics and lore already thought out, so I just need to implement them.
Currently, the drills and conveyors are really messed up, and the only thing that really works are the storms.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know. :)

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
-pygame
-os
-thorpy
-pillow
